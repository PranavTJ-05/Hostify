## HOSTIFY
#### This is a hosting tool something similar to vercel. I have used reverse proxy concept and Dockerization of the github repository and uploading into the AWS Cloud

This is done by first Running the Dockerfile and then it creates a Image in AWS ECR(Elastic container registery) and then the Image created is then uploaded to the AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) from that the dist folder is then hosted, YEHHH learned many things!!!
